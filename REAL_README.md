================================================

This project is a Maven Archetype template.

What that means is that this project contains a simple example project which is used (in conjunction with the Makefile in the home directory) to generate a maven archetype which can then be used to easily create simple projects. 

The following features are supported by this Maven Archetype template:

1. JUnit Tests
2. Embedded Jetty
3. Jersey setup demonstrating simple RESTful web resource.
